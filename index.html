        <h1>Magento Certification Competition</h1>

<p>I am giving away one voucher for a free Magento certification exam. I am hoping that by opening this up, others who are not planning on taking the test will also give away theirs, so there will potentially be more than one available in the future.  For right now, there is only one, and I am giving it away.</p>

<h1>What you have to do for it</h1>

<p>I would like to see some blog posts for the Magento development community. I want everyone to write blog posts about why they choose to develop for Magento.  It doesn't necessarily have to be persuasive, but I'd love to see something that can bring more people into Magento. If I know one thing, it's that every Magento shop on earth is hiring. </p>

<p>In this repo, add your blog post, preferrably as markdown, into the entries folder. You can see an example that I have there.</p>

<h1>Rules</h1>

<p>Every blog post needs to be posted somewhere publicly as well as added as a pull request to this github repo. The winner will be decided by votes from the community in this github repo, so if you're not participating in the contest, make sure to voice your opinion!  A valid vote will be a comment on the pull request showing support.  My voucher is only good until the end of the year, so I will need to have all of the blog posts in and ready for judging by November 30th.  I will close out the PRs and notify the winner by December 3rd 11:59:59PM EST.</p>

<h1>If you have a voucher too</h1>

<p>Please contact me and I'll up the number of prizes for this. It'd be great if we got enough prizes for every blog post!</p>

<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

<p>I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know what to say here except that by participating in this contest, you give up any potentially extant right to sue me for any reason. The following specifies in a little more detail.</p>
